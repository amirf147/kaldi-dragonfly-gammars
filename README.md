# kaldi-dragonfly-rules

## Configuration (Optional)

This script uses a default model directory (`kaldi_model`). If you want to use a different model directory, you can create a `config.py` file in the same directory as this script with the following content:

```python
MODEL_DIRECTORY = 'your_model_directory'
```

Replace `'your_model_directory'` with the path to your model directory. The script will use this value instead of the default one.
